# THE UNSEEN JOURNEY QUEST

## DESCRIPTION
Trapped in a dark maze, you can only see the ground beneath your feet. Somewhere in
the shadows, a hidden key unlocks the way out, but you can’t see it, and you don’t know
where it is. You can sense when you’re moving closer to the key, guiding your steps
through the darkness.
